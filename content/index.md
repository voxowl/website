The Particubes team has always loved Voxel worlds and wanted to make a game on their own!

Particubes is made by Voxowl. Here is the Voxowl team working on Particubes with their Discord names:

With Gaëtan, he has founded Voxowl. Together, they had the idea of creating this cubic and fun project!

His main focus is to create and maintain tools that would help the Voxowl team working in the best conditions.

### Claire - Marketing & Communication
She makes sure that everybody hears about Particubes, gets along with each other within the community and she is the messenger for minor or major updates!

### Xavier “xavierl” - Dev scripting
His objective: making sure the script you write works as expected and provides awesome tools for the coders to make stunning games easily!

### Axel “Truffe” - Dev networking
His role is to connect players to the server so they can play Particubes in multiplayer mode seamlessly and with the lowest latency possible.

### Arthur “Petroglyph” - Dev engine
He works on the cogs & wheels that make your worlds tick, and your colorful scenes to be drawn into view. Made with love and care!

## How did Particubes start?

Adrien and Gaëtan have a strong background in mobile game development. They were also very interested in the crafting system of Minecraft and its multiplayer aspect. Yet, they realized that some features were limited in voxel and sandbox games in general, so they have decided to create a game that would make everything possible. This is how Particubes was born!

You want to know more about the development of Particubes? You can take a look at its roadmap [here] (particubes.com/roadmap) to keep an eye on the latest updates and features!

Also, Voxowl is currently looking for investors to help with the growth of the game and the team. Feel free to contact us at [contact@voxowl.com] (mailto:contact@voxowl.com).
